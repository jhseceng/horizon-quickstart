*A.* If the AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is in the AWS CloudFormation console under *Advanced* on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stackâ€™s state is retained, and the instance remains running so you can troubleshoot the issue.  Also, see Amazon CloudWatch for errors associated with the AWS Lambda functions.

*Q.* My Stack creation fails at `TriggerRegisterAccountLambda` with CREATE_FAILED.
